# Real Estate Inventories 
My data set is a compilation of real estate metrics from realtor.com. This data set contains information about house location, price, days on market, and the amount of listings in a given city. I chose questions that I felt would be both interesting to answer and relevant to the broader public.
What impact does a house's location have on its list price?
What impact does the amount of inventory have on list price?
Is there a correlation between home price and the amount of time the house takes to sell? 

## Introduction 
I chose this data set because I thought it would be interesting to analyze since it has practical applications. Most people in America buy a house at some point, and the questions I answered should provide useful information that can assist them when they are looking for homes. In addition, I think it is interesting how home metrics vary across the country, so I was excited to have a chance to analyze the data more closely.
